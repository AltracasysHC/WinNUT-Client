# WinNUT-Client
This is a NUT windows client for monitoring your ups hooked up to your favorite linux server.
Now you don't need to vnc or ssh into the box to see how your ups is doing!

This project is forked from https://sourceforge.net/projects/winnutclient/

#Installation
This is preliminary (very beta) release of the software.
In order to use please perform the following steps :
1. Extract the files from the zip
2. Edit the ups.ini to suit your NUT server settings
(You may skip this step and do it later from the gui)
3. Run the exe and Go to Settings->Preferences to set your connection properties or change Color of the panels.
