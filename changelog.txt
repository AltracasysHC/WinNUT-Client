History:

#Version 2.0.5.0
#Changed : Some changes on how logs work (Thanks to tgp1994)
#Fix : app crash when disconnecting with null streams (Thanks to tgp1994) (Issue #48)
#Fix : Correction of a bad state of the Notify Icon Text when the return value of ups status is not only "OL" (Issue #45)
#Fix : Add -f parameter to force shutdown (Issue #46)
#Added : Some modifications provided by tgp1994
#Added : Addition of a directory containing the translations at the repository level.
#		Makes it easier to submit a new translation (or correction) via a fork / pull request (nonPointer idea - issue # 35)

Version 2.0.4.0
Added: EXPERIMENTAL - Connection function to the nut server with identification and password.
Fix : When the "Minimize to tray" option is disabled but the "Start Minimized" and "close to tray" options are active, 
reducing or closing sends the application to the systray without the possibility of having access to the icon notification
Fix : When the name of the UPS in the parameters is incorrect, it is no longer possible to display the UPS variable information window.
Fix : Fixed a typo preventing shutdown at the end of the timeout
Fix/Added : When the name of the UPS in the parameters is incorrect, the connection is not established and a notification is displayed for 10 seconds.
Added : When the application is minimized in the systray and a change of connection state to the Nut server or a change of state of the UPS 
occurs, a notification popup is displayed for 10 seconds.
Added : When the application is minimized without being sent to the systray (in task bar), the connection and battery status is displayed 
in the text of the window in order to be quickly visualized when the application icon is hovered in the task bar.
Changed : The application icon has been modified to add an outline to the white shape in order to be visible when it is on a white background
Changed : The arrows of the icon displayed during reconnection are now in yellow to be more visible due to their small size.
Changed : The import of an old Ini file has been modified. The function is no longer automatic due to a problem with access rights to the 
default installation directory. The import is now started manually from the File menu
Changed : The behavior of the extinction count progress bar has been corrected and behaves in a more fluid and consistent way
Changed : Restoring the main window from the notification icon only requires a single click (double click previously required)

Version 2.0.3.0
Fix : Application crash when opening the 'UPS Variable' window
Fix : No feedback when checking for update (manual or automatic)

Version 2.0.2.0
Fix : All hard-coded translations are translated
Fix : The log file is now correctly created
Added : Some Translations

Version 2.0.1.0
Fix : several problems when loading WinNUt as well as an incorrect value for the instantaneous power displayed on the graph of the instantaneous load (Thanks to Ririx02)

Version 2.0.0.0
Complete rewrite of WinNUT in Visual Basic (the .Net Framework 4.5 is required to run WInNUT)
Modification of the graphic part using the AGauge component (https://github.com/Code-Artist/AGauge) under MIT license.
The AGauge component has been modified to adapt it to the needs of WinNUT and all the sources are supplied with WinNUT.
For the automatic import of the Ini file, the Class written by L. Jerabek was used 
   (https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/21896/INI-Reader-Writer-Class-for-C-VB-NET-and-VBScript)
All the functions present in the AutoIt version are still present in V2 with some additions / modifications:

- Possibilities to export all variables from the UPS to the clipboard (from the "UPS variable" window)
- It is no longer necessary to run WinNUT as administrator
- The configuration of WinNUT is no longer in an ini file but directly stored in the registry (CURRENT_USER)
- Ability to automatically import your old config file (ups.ini). The import is automatic when WinNut is launched 
  if an ups.in file is present in the same directory as the executable.
- The Update part no longer uses a second program to perform the update, the releases being in the form of an msi file, 
  WinNUT is closed during the update and then reopened once the new version is installed.
- It is now possible to uninstall WinNUT from the "Program / Functionality" part of Windows
- WinNUT no longer suffers from detection as a Virus since it is no longer developed under AutoIT
- WinNUT is also natively multi-language, so it is no longer necessary to select the language from the interface.
  The default language, however, is always EN-Us in case your language is not supported.
  An Xls file is available to send me a translation in a new language.
  This will require an addition in a new build and therefore an update of WinNut

Version 1.8.0.3
Change : WinNUT is ready to update to version 2

Version 1.8.0.2
Fix : Correction of a bad state of the UPS when the return value is not only "OL"

Version 1.8.0.1
Fix : Rounded Value for second displayed value in Graph

Version 1.8.0.3
Change : WinNUT is ready to update to version 2

Version 1.8.0.2
Fix : Correction of a bad state of the UPS when the return value is not only "OL"

Version 1.8.0.1
Fix : Rounded Value for second displayed value in Graph

Version 1.8.0.0
Added : Compatibility with IPV6 (Experimental)
Added : Capacity to update directly from WinNut (Addition of an executable Updater packaged in WinNUT and therefore installed with WinNut on its first launch)
Added : Ability to display a second value on graphs (text value only and value not already used)
Changed : The executable is no longer called "upsclient.exe" but "WinNUT-client.exe"
Changed : DrawDial function moved to nutDraw.au3 file
Fix : Significant slowdown caused by the Logging functionality and memory leak caused by this same functionality
Fix : Working Fallback Value on GetUPSVar
Changed : When changing languages, it is no longer necessary to restart WinNUT. The window closes and reopens automatically with the new language.
Fix : When the preferences are open but no modification is made, there is no longer a reconnection when clicking on the OK / Apply buttons 
      (which could generate a flickering of the dials and unnecessary entries in the logs)
Fix : Incorrect calculation of the instantaneous power used

Version 1.7.9.9
Not Released
Change/Add :  Graphic redesign of the icons as well as the setting of dynamic icons according to the connection/reconnection state, the connection state of
	      the inverter and also the charge/discharge state of the battery.

Version 1.5.0.0
Added : Calibration for all clocks except battery charge.
Now you can suite the program to your ups readings.
For example if you are in USA and your UPS supplies 30V when
fully charged set the values as follows :
Input Voltage Min 50 , Input Voltage Max 150
Output Voltage Min 50 , Output Voltage Max 150 
Input Frequency Min 30 , Input Frequency Max 80 (Center at 60Hz).
Battery Voltage Min 0 , Battery Voltage Max 50
This is of course only an example and you may set the values
the way you like.
At this moment no checking is done on values used so please be reasonable with what you enter (no negative numbers , max less the min etc).
In order to change calibration go to Settings->Preferences.
Select Calibration TAB and change the values as required.
Then press OK or APPLY.
After you close the Preferences window clocks will be refreshed and updated with new settings.
Added : Minimize to tray (Requested by druidtaliesin).
In order to toggle go to Settings->Preferences.
Select Misc TAB and check the appropriate option.
Click OK or APPLY to save the changes
It is off by default.
Added : Shutdown PC if battery charge lower then specified value
In order to change go to Settings->Preferences.
Select Misc TAB and type in the battery charge percentage at which
you want your pc to shutdown if UPS is offline.
Click OK or APPLY to save the changes.
ATTENTION this option is DANGEROUS!
The computer is shutdown forcibly so if you have any unsaved documents and set the value too high while UPS was offline , you might lose data.
Please use with care.
By default the value is 0 which effectively disables this option.
Notice : Compiled with latest release of AutoIT which hopefully should speed things up a little bit.
Notice : Rewritten most of configuration management code.
It is much more readable now and also much easier to add new options.
