History:

Version 1.8.0.0
Added : Compatibility with IPV6 (Experimental)
Added : Capacity to update directly from WinNut (Addition of an executable Updater packaged in WinNUT and therefore installed with WinNut on its first launch)
Added : Ability to display a second value on graphs (text value only and value not already used)
Changed : The executable is no longer called "upsclient.exe" but "WinNUT-client.exe"
Changed : DrawDial function moved to nutDraw.au3 file
Fix : Significant slowdown caused by the Logging functionality and memory leak caused by this same functionality
Fix : Working Fallback Value on GetUPSVar
Changed : When changing languages, it is no longer necessary to restart WinNUT. The window closes and reopens automatically with the new language.
Fix : When the preferences are open but no modification is made, there is no longer a reconnection when clicking on the OK / Apply buttons 
      (which could generate a flickering of the dials and unnecessary entries in the logs)
Fix : Incorrect calculation of the instantaneous power used

Changed : some code optimisation
Changed : Some aesthetic improvement of GUI
Changed : tray icon improvment

Version 1.5.0.0
Added : Calibration for all clocks except battery charge.
Now you can suite the program to your ups readings.
For example if you are in USA and your UPS supplies 30V when
fully charged set the values as follows :
Input Voltage Min 50 , Input Voltage Max 150
Output Voltage Min 50 , Output Voltage Max 150 
Input Frequency Min 30 , Input Frequency Max 80 (Center at 60Hz).
Battery Voltage Min 0 , Battery Voltage Max 50
This is of course only an example and you may set the values
the way you like.
At this moment no checking is done on values used so please be reasonable with what you enter (no negative numbers , max less the min etc).
In order to change calibration go to Settings->Preferences.
Select Calibration TAB and change the values as required.
Then press OK or APPLY.
After you close the Preferences window clocks will be refreshed and updated with new settings.
Added : Minimize to tray (Requested by druidtaliesin).
In order to toggle go to Settings->Preferences.
Select Misc TAB and check the appropriate option.
Click OK or APPLY to save the changes
It is off by default.
Added : Shutdown PC if battery charge lower then specified value
In order to change go to Settings->Preferences.
Select Misc TAB and type in the battery charge percentage at which
you want your pc to shutdown if UPS is offline.
Click OK or APPLY to save the changes.
ATTENTION this option is DANGEROUS!
The computer is shutdown forcibly so if you have any unsaved documents and set the value too high while UPS was offline , you might lose data.
Please use with care.
By default the value is 0 which effectively disables this option.
Notice : Compiled with latest release of AutoIT which hopefully should speed things up a little bit.
Notice : Rewritten most of configuration management code.
It is much more readable now and also much easier to add new options.
